# Day 11: Promises async/Await
Tasks/Activities: 

## Activity 1: Unerstanding Promises 
 - Task 1: Create a promise that resolves with a message after a 2-second timeout and log the message to the console. 
 - Task 2: Create a promise that rejects with an error message after a 2-second timeout and handle the error using `.catch()`. 

## Activity 2: Chaining Promises 
 - Task 3: Create a sequence of promises that simulate fetching data from a server. Chain the promises to log messages in a specific order. 

## Activity 3: Using Async/Await
 - Task 4: Write an async function that waits for a promise to resolve and then logs the resolved value. 
 - Task 5: write an async function that handles a rejected promise using `try-catch` and logs the error message. 

## Activity 4: Fetching data from an API 
 - Task 6: Use the `fetch` API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using promises. 
 - Task 7: Use the `fetch` API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using aync/await. 

## Activity 5: Concurrent Promises
 - Task 8: Use `promise.all` to wait for multiple promise to resolve and then log all their values. 
 - Task 9: Use `promise.race` to log the value of the first promise that resolves among multiple promises. 

## Feature Request: 
 1. <b>Promise creation script</b>: Write a script that demonstrates creating and handling promises, including both resolved and rejected states. 
 2. <b>Promise chaining script</b>: Create a script that chains multiple promises and logs messages in a spacific sequence. 
 3. <b>Async/Await Script</b>: Write a script that uses async/await to handle promises and include promises and includes error handling with try-catch. 
 4. <b>API fetch secript</b>: Create a script that fetches data from a public API using both promises and async/await, and log the response data. 
 5. <b>Concurrent promises script</b>: Write a script that uses `promise.all` and `promise.race` to handle multiple promises concurrently and log the results. 

## Achievement: 
by the end of these activities, student will: 
 - Understand and create promises, including handling resolved and reected states. 
 - Chain multiple promises to perform sequential asynchrnous operation. 
 - Use async/await to handle asynchronous code more readably. 
 - Manage multiple concurrent promises using `promise.all` and `promise.race`.
