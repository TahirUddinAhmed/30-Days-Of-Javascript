# Day 21: LeetCode Easy 
Tasks/Activities: 

## Activity 1: Two sum 
 - Task 1: Solve the "Two Sum" Problem on LeetCode
   - write a function that takes an array of numbers and a target number and returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target. 
   - Log the indices for a few Test Cases. 

## Activity 2: Reverse Interger 
 - Task 2: Solve the `Reverse interger` Problem on leetcode.
    - Write a function that takes an integer and returns it with its digits reversed. 
    - Handle edge cases like negative numbers and numbers eding in zero. 
    - Log the reversed integers for a few test cases.

## Activity 3: Palidrome Number 
 - Task 3: Solve the "Palidrome Number" problem on Leetcode. 
    - Write a function that takes an integer and returns true if it is a palidrome, and false otherwise. 
    - Log the result for a few test cases, including edge cases like negative numbers. 

## Merge Two Sorted Lists 
 - Task 4: Solve the "Merge Two Sorted Lists" problem on Leetcode. 
    - Write a function that takes two sorted linked listss and returns a nnew sorted list by merging them.
    - Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the merged list. 

## Acitvity 5: Valid Parentheses 
 - Task 5: Solve the "Valid Parentheses" Problem on leetcode. 
   - Write a function that takes a string containing just the characters '(', ')' '{', '}', '[', ']', and determines if the input string is valid. 
   - A string is valid if open brackets are closed in the correct order. 
   - Log the result for few test cases. 

## Feature Request: 
 1. Two Sum Script: Write a script that includes a function to solve the "Two Sum" problem and logs the indices of the two numbers. 
 2. Reverse integer script: Create a script that includes a function to reverse an integer and handles edge cases. 
 3. Palindrome number script: Write a script that includes a function to check if an integer is a palidrome and logs the result. 
 4. Merge two sorted lists script: Create a script that includes a function to merge two sorted linked list and logs the merged list. 
 5. Valid parentheses script: Write a script that includes a function to check if a string parenthese is valid and logss the result. 

## Achievement: 
By the end of these activities, students will: 
 - Solve common leetcode problems. 
 - Apply problem solving skills to implement algorithms. 
 - Understand and handle edge cases in algorithms solutions. 
 - Gain confidence in solving easy-level coding challenges on leetcode.
