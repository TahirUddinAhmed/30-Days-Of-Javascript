# Day 23: LeetCode Hard 
Tasks/Activites: 

## Activity 1: Medium of Two Sorted Arrays
 - Task 1: Solve the "Medium of Two Sorted Arrays" problem on leetcode. 
   - Write a function that takes two sorted arrays of integers and returns the median of the two sorted arrays. 
   - Log the median for a few test cases, including edge cases. 

## Activity 2: Merge K Sorted Lists
 - Task 2: Solve the "Merge K Sorted Lists" problem on leetcode. 
   - Write a function that takes an array of k linked lists, each linked list is sorted in ascending order, and merges all the linked lists onto one sorted linked list. 
   - Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the merges list. 

## Activity 3: Trapping rain water 
 - Task 3: solve the 'Trapping rain water' problem on leetcode. 
    - write afunction that takes an array of non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, and computes how much water it can trap after raining. 
    - Log the amount of trapped water for a few test cases. 

## Activity 4: N-Queens
 - Task 4: Solve the "N-Queens" Problem on leetcode.
    - Write a function that places n queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens attack each other, and returns all distinct solution to the n-queens puzzle. 
    - Log the distinct solution for a few test cases. 

## Activity 5: Word Ladder 
 - Task 5: Solve the "Word Ladder" problem on leetcode. 
    - Write a function that takes a begin word, and end word and a dictionary of words, and find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from the begin word to the end word, such that only one letter can be changess at a time and each transformed word must exists in the word list. 
    - Log the length of the shortest transformation sequence for a few test cases.
