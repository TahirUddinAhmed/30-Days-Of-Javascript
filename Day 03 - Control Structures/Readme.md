# Day 3: Control Structures
Task/Activities: 
## Activity 1: if-else statements
 - Task 1: Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero, and log the result to the console. 
 - Task 2: Write a program to check if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18) and log the result to the console. 

## Activity 2: Nested if-else statements
 - Task 3: Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using nested if-else statements. 

## Acitivty 3: Switch Case 
 - Task 4: Write a program that uses a switch case tto determine the day of the weeek based on a number (1-7) and log the day name to the console. 
 - Task 5: Write a program that uses a switch case to assing a grade ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F') based on a score and log the grade to the console. 

## Activity 4: Conditional (Ternary) Operator 
 - Task 6: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd and lo the result to the console. 

## Activity 5: Combining Conditions 
- Task 7: Write a program to check if a year is leap yeear using multiple conditions (Divisible by 4, but not 100 unless also divisibleby 400) and log the result to the console. 

## Feature Request: 
 1. Number check script: Write a script that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using the if-else statements and logs the result. 
 2. Voting Eligibility Script: Crete a script to check if a person is eligible to vote based on their age and log the result. 
 3. Day to the week script: Write a script that uses a swithc cccase to determine the day to the week based on a number (1-7) abd logs the day name. 
 4. Grade assignment script: Create a script that uses a switch case to assign a grade based on a score and logs the grade. 
 5. Leap Year check script: Write a script that checks if a year is a leap year using multiple conditions and logs the result. 

## Achievement: 
By the end of these activities, students will: 
 1. Implement and understand basic if-else control flow. 
 2. Use nested if-else statements to hadle multiple conditions. 
 3. Utilize switch cases for control flow based on specific values. 
 4. Apply the ternary operator for concise condition checking. 
 5. Combine multiple conditions to solve more complex problems.
