# Day 19 - Regular expression 
Tasks/Activities

## Activity 1: Basic regular expressions 
 - Task 1: Write a regular expression to match a simple pattern (e.g., match all occurances of the word `Javascript` in a string). Log the matches. 
 - Task 2: Write a regular expression to match all digits in a string. Log the matches. 

## Activity 2: Character classes and Quantifiers 
 - Task 3: Write a regular expression to match all words in a string that start with a capital letter. Log the matches. 
 - Task 4: Write a regular expression to match all sequences of one or more digits in a string. Log the matches. 

## Activity 3: Grouping and capturing 
 - Task 5: Write a regular expression to capture the area code, central office code, and line number from a US phone number format (e.g., (123) 456-789). Log the captures. 
 - Task 6: Write a regular expression to capture the username and domain from an email address. Log the captures. 

## Activity 4: Assertions and Boundaries 
 - Task 7: Write a regular expression to match a word only if it is at the beginning of a string. Log the matches. 
 - Task 8: Write a regular expression to match a word only if it is at the end of a string. Log the matches. 

## Activity 5: Practical Applications 
 - Task 9: Write a regular expression to validate a simple password (must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character). Log whether the password is valid. 
 - Task 10: Write a regular expression to validate a URL. Log whether the URL is valid. 

## Feature Request: 
 1. Basic regex script: write a script that uses regular expressions to match simple patterns and log the matches. 
 2. Character classes and quantifiers script: Create a script that uses regular expression to match works with specific characteristics and log the matches. 
 3. Grouping and capturing script: Write a script that uses regular expressions to capture parts of a string, such as phone numbers and email address, and log thhe captures. 
 4. Assertions and boundaries script: Create a script that uses regular expression to match words at specific positions in a string and log the matches. 
 5. Validate script: write a script that uses regular expressions to validate passwords and URLs and log whether they are valid. 

## Achievement: 
By the end of these activities, students will: 
 1. Understand and create basic regular expressions. 
 2. Use character classes and quantifiers in regular expressions. 
 3. Implement grouping and capturing in regular expression. 
 4. Apply assertions and boundaries in regular expressions. 
 5. Use regular expressions for practical applications like validating passwords and URLs.
