# Day 2 Operators 
Tasks/Activites:

## Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
 - Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console. 
 - Task 2: Write a program to substract two numbers and log the result to the console. 
 - Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console. 
 - Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console. 
 - Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console. 

## Activity 2: Assignment Operators 
 - Task 6: Use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console. 
 - Task 7: Use the `-=` Operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console. 

## Activity 3: Comparison Operators
 - Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using `>` and `<` and log the result to the console. 
 - Task 9: Write a program to compare two number using `>=` and `<=` andlog the result to the console. 
 - Task 10: Write a program to compare two number using `==` and `===` and log the result to the console. 

## Activity 4: Logical Operators 
 - Task 11: Write a program that uses the `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console. 
 - Task 12: Write a program that uses the `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console. 
 - Task 13: Write a program that uses the `!` operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

## Activity 5: Ternary Operator 
 - Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console. 

## Feature Request: 
 1. <b>Arithmetic Operations Script</b>: Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results. 
 2. <b>Comparison And Logical Operators Script</b>: Create script that compares two numbers using differnt comparison Operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results. 
 3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and log the result. 

## Achievement: 
By the end of these activites, students will: 
 - Undertand and uses arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations. 
 - Use assignment operators to modify variable values. 
 - Compare values using comparison operatos. 
 - Combine conditions using logical operators. 
 - Use the ternary operator to concise conditional expressions.
