# Day 8 - ES6+ Features 
Tasks/Activities: 

## Activity 1: Template Literals
 - Task 1: Use template literals to create a string that includes variable for a person's name and age, and log the string to the console. 
 - Task 2: Create a multi-line string using template literals and log it to the console. 

## Activity 2: Destructuring 
 - Task 3: Use array destructuring to extract the first and second elements from an array of numbers and log them to the console. 
 - Task 4: Use object destructuring to extract the title and author from a book object and log them to the console.

## Activity 3: Spread and Rest Operators
 - Task 5: Use the spread operator to create a new array that includes all elements of an existing array plug additional elements, and log the new array to the console. 
 - Task 6: Use the rest operator in a function to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, sum them, and return the result. 

## Activity 4: Default Parameters
 - Task 7: Write a function that takes two parameters and return their product, with the second parameter having a default value of 1. Log the result of calling this function with and without the second parameter. 

## Activity 5: Enhanced Object Literals
 - Task 8: Use enhanced object literals to create an object with methods and properties, with computed property names based on variables and log the object to the console. 

## Feature Request: 
 1. <b>Template Literals Script</b>: Write a script that demonstrates the use of template literals to create and log string with embedded variables and multi-line strings. 
 2. <b>Destructuring script</b>: Create a script that uses array and object destructuring to extract values and log them. 
 3. <b>Spread and Rest Operators</b>: Write a script that demonstrates the use of the spread operator to combine arrays and the rest operator to handle multiple function arguments. 
 4. <b>Default Parameters</b>: Crate a script that defines a function with default parameters and logs the results of calling it with different arguments. 
 5. <b>Enhanced Object Literal Script</b>: Write a script that uses enhanced object literals to create and log an object with methods and computed property names. 

## Achievement: 
By the end of these activites, student will: 
 - Understand and use template literals for string interpolation and multi-line strings.
 - Apply destructuring to extract values from arrays and objects. 
 - Untilize spread and rest operators for array manipulation and function arguments. 
 - Define functions with default paramenters. 
 - Create objects using enhanced object literals, including methods and computed property names.
