# Day 15: Closures 
Tasks/Activities: 

## Ativity 1: Understanding Closures 
 - Task 1: Write a function that returns another function. Where the inner function accesses a variable from the outer function's scope. Call the inner function and log the result. 
 - Task 2: Create a closure that maintains a private counter. Implement functions to increment and get current value of the counter. 

## Activity 2: Practical closures 
 - Task 3: Write a function that generates unique IDs. Use a closure to keep track of the last generated ID and increment it with each call. 
 - Task 4: Create a closure that captures a user's name and return's a function that greets the user by name. 

## Activity 3: Closures in Loops 
 - Task 5: Write a loop that creates an array of functions. Each function should log its index when called. Use a closure to ensure each function log the corrent index. 

## Activity 4: Module Pattern 
 - Task 6: Use closures to create a simple module for managing a collection of items. Implements methods to add, remove, and list items. 

## Activity 5: Memorization
 - Task 7: Write a function that memorizes the results of another function. Use a closure to store the results of previous computations. 
 - Task 8: Create a memoize version of a function that calculates the factorial of a number. 

## Feature Request: 
 1. <b>Basic closure script</b>: write a script that demonstrates a basic closure with a function returning another function that accesses the outer functions variabe. 
 2. <b>Counter closure script</b>: Create a script that uses a closure to maintain a private counter with increment and get functions. 
 3. <b>Unique Id Generator script</b>: Write a script that generates unique IDs using a closure to keep track of the last generated ID. 
 4. <b>Loop Closure Script</b>: Create a script that demonstrates closures in loops to ensure functions log the correct index. 
 5. <b>Memoization script</b>: Write a script that memoize the results of a function and demonstrates it with a factorial calculation. 

## Achievement: 
By the end of these activities, students will: 
 - Understand and create closures in javascript. 
 - Use closures to maintain private state and create encapsulated modules. 
 - Apply closuress in practical scenarios like generating unique Ids and memoization. 
 - Use closures in loops to capture and use variable correctly.
