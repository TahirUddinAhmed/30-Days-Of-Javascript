# Day 22: Leetcode medium 
Tasks/Activites: 

## Activity 1: Add Two Numbers 
 - Task 1: Solve the "Add Two Numbers" problem on LeetCode. 
   - Wrtie a function that takes two no-empty linked lits representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. 
   - Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the sum as a linked list. 

## Activity 2: Lognest substring without repeating characters 
 - Task 2: Solve the "Longest substring without repeating" character problem on LeetCode. 
   - Write a function that takes a string and retuens the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 
   - Log the length for a fe test cases, including edge cases. 

## Activity 3: Container with most water 
 - Task 3: Solvve the "Container with most water" problem on leetcode. 
   - Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a line drawn at eact point. Find the container hoolds the most water. 
   - Log the maximum amount of water for a few test cases. 

## Activity 4: 3Sum 
 - Task 4: Solve the "3Sum" problem on leetcode. 
   - Write a function that takes an array of integers and finds all unique triplets in the array which give the sum of zero. 
   - Log the triplets for a few test cases, including edge cases. 

## Activity 5: Group Anagrams 
 - Task 5: Solve the "Group anagrams" problem on leetcode. 
   - Write a function that takes an array of strings and group anagrams together. 
   - Log the grouped anagrams for a few test cases.
