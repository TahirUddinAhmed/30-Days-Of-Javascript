# Day 5: Functions
Tasks/Activites

## Activity 1: Function Declaration
 - Task 1: Write a function to check if a number is even or odd and log the result to the console. 
 - Task 2: Write a function to calculate the square of a number and return the result. 

## Activity 2: Function Expression 
 - Task 3: Write a function expression to find the maximum of two numbers and log the result to the console. 
 - Task 4: Write a function expression to concatenate two strings and return the result. 

## Activity 3: Arrow Functions 
 - Task 5: Write an arrow function to calculate the sum of two numbbers and return the result. 
 - Task 6: Write a arrow function to check if a string contains a spacific character and return a boolean value. 

## Activity 4: Function Parameters and Default values
 - Task 7: Write a function that takes two parameters and returns their product. Provide a default value for the second parameter
 - Task 8: Write a function that takes a person's name and age and returns a greeting message. Provide a default value for the age. 

## Activity 5: Higher-Order Functions 
 - Task 9: Write a higher-order function that takes a function and a number, and calls the function that many times. 
 - Task 10: Write a higher-order function that takes two functions and a value, applies the first function to the value, and then applies the second function to the result. 

## Feature Request: 
 1. <b>Even Or Odd Function Script</b>: Write  script that includes a function to check if a number is even or odd and log the result 
 2. <b>Square Calculation functtion script</b>: Create a script that includes a function to calculate the square of anumber and returns the result.
 3. <b>Concatenation Function Script</b>: Write a script that includes a function expression to concatenate two string and returns the result. 
 4. <b>Sum Calculation arrow function script</b>: Ceate a script that includes an arrow function to calculate the sum of two numbers and returns the result. 
 5. <b>higher-order Function Script</b>: Write a script that includes a higher-order function to apply a given function multiple times. 

## Achievment: 
By the end of these acitivites, student will: 
 - Understand and define function using function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
 - Use function parameters and default values effectively. 
 - Apply functions to solve common problems and perform calculations. 
 - Enhance Code reusability and organization using functions.
