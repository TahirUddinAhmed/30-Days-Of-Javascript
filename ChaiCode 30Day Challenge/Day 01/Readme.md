# Day 1: Variables and Data Types
Tasks/Activites: 

## Activity 1: Variable Declaration
 - Taks 1: Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a number, and long the value to the console.
 - Task 2: Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a string, and log the value to the console. 

## Activity 2: Constant Declaration
 - Task 3: Declare a variable using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console. 

## Activity 3: Data Types
 - Task 4: Create variables of different data types (numbers, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using `typeof` operator. 

## Activity 4: Reassing Variables
 - Task 5: Declare a variable using `let`, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console. 

## Activity 5: Understanding `const`
 - Task 6: Try reassign a variable declared with `const` and observe the error. 

## Feature Request: 
 1. Variable Types Console Log: write a script that declares variables of different data types and log both the value and type of each variable to the console. 
 2. Reassigning Demo: Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between `let` and `const` when it comes to reassignment.

## Achievement: 
By the endn of these activities, you will: 
 - Know how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
 - Understand the different data types in Javascript. 
 - Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable. 
 - Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.
