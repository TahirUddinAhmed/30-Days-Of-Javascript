# Day 4: Loops
Tasks/Activites: 

## Activity 1: for Loop 
 - Task 1: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop. 
 - Task 2: Write a program to print the multiplication table for 5 using a for loop. 

## Activity 2: While Loop 
 - Task 3: Write a program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 t 10 uing a while loop. 
 - Task 4: Write a program to print numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop. 

## Activity 3: do..while loop 
 - Task 5: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a do..while loop.
 - Task 6: Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using do..while loop. 

## Activity 4: Nested Loops 
 - Task 7: Write a program to print a pattern using nested for loops.

## Activity 5: Loop Control Statements 
 - Task 8: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but skip the number 5 using the `continue` statement.
 - Task 9: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but stop the loop when the number is 7 using the `break` statement. 

## Feature Request: 
 1. <b>Number Printing Script</b>: Write a script that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop and a while loop. 
 2. <b>Multiplication table script</b>: Create a script that prints the multiplication table for 5 using a for loop. 
 3. <b>Pattern Printing script</b>: Write a script that prints a pattern of stars using nested loops. 
 4. <b>Sum Calculation Script</b>: Write a script that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop. 
 5. <b>Factorial Calculcation Script</b>: Create a script that calculates the factorial of a number using a do..while loop.

## Achievement:
By the end of these activites, students will: 
 - understand and use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
 - Utilize while loops for iteration based on a condition. 
 - Apply do..while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once. 
 - Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems. 
 - Use loop control statements (`break` and `continue`) to control the flow of loops.
