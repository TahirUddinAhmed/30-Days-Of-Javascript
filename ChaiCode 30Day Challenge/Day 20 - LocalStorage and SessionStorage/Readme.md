# Day 20 - LocalStorage and SessionStorage
Tasks/Activities: 

## Activity 1: Understanding LocalStorage
 - Task 1: Write a script to save a string value to `localstorage` and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value. 
 - Task 2: Write a script to save an object to `localStorage` by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it. 

## Activity 2: Using LocalStorage
 - Task 3: Create a simple form that saves user input(e.g., name, and email) to `localStorage` when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load. 
 - Task 4: Write a script to remove and item from `localStorage` Log the `localStorage` content before and after removal. 

## Activity 3: Understanding SessionStorage
 - Task 5: Write a script to save a string value to `sessionStorage` and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value. 
 - Task 6: Write a script to save an object to `sessionStorage` by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it. 

## Activity 4: Using SessionStorage
 - Task 7: Create a simple form that saves user input (e.g., name and email) to `sessionStorage` when submitted. Retrieve and display the saved data on page load. 
 - Task 8: Write a script to remove an item from `sessionStorage`. Log the `sessionStorage` content before and after removal. 

## Activity 5: comparing localStorage and SessionStorage
 - Task 9: Write a function that accepts a key and a value, and saves the value to both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Retrieve and log the values from both storage machanisms. 
 - Task 10: Write a function that clears all data from both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Verify that both storages are empty. 

## Feature Request: 
 1. <b>LocalStorage Script</b>: Write a script that saves, and removes item from `localStorage`, and displays the saved data on page load. 
 2. <b>SessionStorage Script</b>: Create a script that saves, retrieves, and removes items from `sessionStorage`, display the saved data on page load. 
 3. <b>Storage Comparison script</b>: Write a script that saves data to both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, retrieves the data, and compares the results. 
 4. <b>Clear Storage Script</b>: Create a script that clears all data from both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, and verifies the operation. 

## Achievement: 
By the end of these activities, students will: 
 - Understand how to use `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for persistent and session-specific data storage. 
 - Save, retrieve, and remove data from both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.
 - Implement form data storage using `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. 
 - compare and contrast the use cases for `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.
