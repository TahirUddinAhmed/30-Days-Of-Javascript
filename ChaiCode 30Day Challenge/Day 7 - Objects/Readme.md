# Day 7: Objects
Tasks/Activity: 

## Activity 1: Object creation and access
 - Task 1: Create an object representing a book with properties like title, author, and year, and log the object to the console. 
 - Task 2: Access and log thee title and author properties of the book object. 

## Activity 2: Object Methods
 - Task 3: Add a method to the book object that returns a string with the bookss title and author, and log the result of calling `this` method. 
 - Task 4: Add a method to the book object that takes a parameter(year) and updates the book's year property, then log the updated object. 
 
## Activity 3: nested objects
 - Task 5: Create a nested object representing a library with properties like name and books (an array of book objects), and log the library object to the console. 
 - Task 6: Access and log the name of the library and the titles of all the books in the library. 

## Activity 4: The `this` Keyword
 - Task 7: Add a method to the book object that uses the `this` keyword to return a string with the book's title and year, and log the result of calling `this` method. 

## Activity 5: Object Iteration
 - Task 8: use a `for..in` loop to iterate over the properties of the book object and log each property and its value. 
 - Task 9: Use `Object.keys` and `Object.values` methods to log all the keys and values of the book object.

## Feature Request: 
 1. <b>Book Object Script</b>: Write a script that creates a book object, adds methods to it, and logs its properties and method results. 
 2. <b>Library Object Script</b>: Create a script that defines a library object containing an array of book objects and logs the library's details. 
 3. <b>Object Iteration Script</b>: Write a script that demonstrates iterating over an object's properties using `for..in` loop and `Object.keys` `Object.values`.

## Achievement: 
By the end of these activites, student will: 
 - Create and manipulate objects with properties and methods. 
 - Understand and use the `this` keyword in object methods. 
 - Work with nested objects and arrayss of objects. 
 - Iterate over an object's properties using loops and built-in methods.
