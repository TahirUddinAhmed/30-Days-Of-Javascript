# Day 16: Recursion 
Tasks/Activities: 

## Activity 1: Basic Recursion 
 - Task 1: Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. Log the result for a few test cases. 
 - Task 2: Write a recursive function to calcaulate the nth Fibonacci number. Log the result for a few test cases. 

## Activity 2: Recursion with Arrays 
 - Task 3: Write a recursive function to find the sum of all elements in an array. Log the result for a few test cases. 
 - Task 4: Write a recursive function to find the maximum element in an array. Log the result for a few test cases. 

## Acitivity 3: String Manipulation with Recursion 
 - Task 5: Write a recursive function to reverse a string. log the result for a few test cases. 
 - Task 6: Write aa recursive function to check if a string is a palidrome. Log the result for a few test cases. 

## Acitivity 4: Recursive Search 
 - Task 7: Write a recursive function to perform a binary search on a sorted array. Log the index of the target element for a few test cases. 
 - Task 8: Write a recursive function to count the occurences of a target element in an array. Log the result for a few test cases. 

## Activity 5: Tree Traversal (optional)
 - Task 9: Write a recursive function to perform an in-order traversal of a binary tree. Log the nodes as they are visited. 
 - Task 10: Write a recursive function to calculate the depth of a binary tree. Log the result for a few test cases. 

## Feature Request: 
 1. Factorial and fibonacci script: Write a script that includes recursive functions to calculate the factorial and fibonacci numbers. 
 2. Array Recursion script: Create a script that includes recursive functions to find the sum and maximum element of an array. 
 3. String recursion script: Write a script that includes recursive function to reverse a string and check if a string is a palindrome. 
 4. Recursive search script: Create a script that includes recursive function for binary search and counting occurences in an array. 
 5. Tree Traversal Script: Write a script that includes recursive functions for in-order traversal and depth calculation for a binary tree (Optional).

## Achievement: 
By the end of these activities, student will:
